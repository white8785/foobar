# foobar
Code from Google's recruiting invitation.

I completed a google search for `dependency injection`, and all of a sudden the google page started moving weirdly.
The page slid down to reveal a hidden prompt asking if I would like to solve an interesting problem.  How can I resist?  How can I

This repo is dedicated to the work that took place while exploring on this adventure.

I'm dropped into a command line interface with some familiar controls.

Poking around the available commands it become clear my next step was to `request` a challenge.

# Challenge 1 is presented.

## Solution
[Challenge1.py](https://github.com/white8785/foobar/blob/main/challenge1.py#L1-L72) is the solution submitted for this challenge.  It involved creating a data structure to represent an array of booleans that represented the range of numbers required for processing.

Looks like I did well on this one as it marked `Level 1` as 100%.  Woot woot!


# Challenge 2 is presented.

## Solution
[Challenge2.py](https://github.com/white8785/foobar/blob/main/challenge2.py#L66-L160) is the solution submitted for this challenge.  Google took the knights graph and shortest path challenges, and and added a mapping exercise on top.  Instead of providing a coordinate, they provide a value that has its board location identified for the coordinates instead.

The solution passed all tests, but the system marked my answer at 50%.  I'm assuming it's due to length of time it took to submit the solution.  Instead of improving the value look up's time complexity I chose to hang out with the family this weekend.

# Challenge 3 will be requested between Dec 14 - 17
